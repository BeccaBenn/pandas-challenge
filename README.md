- This analysis examines the reading and math preformances within the PyCity School District.

Reading and math testing scores at each school have been compared using numerous variables; spending per student, size of the school, whether the school is a district school or a charter school, and across the different grades.

Conclusions

The report shows that the size and type of school play a larger role in student preformance than how much is spent per student.
The largest schools, with a range of students from 2,000-5,000, show the lowest average results in both math and reading preformance. While schools with under 1,000 students, and schools with 1,00-2,000, students have very similar results.

There is a significant difference in the passing rates within the charter schools and the district schools. Charters schools have overall passing rate of 90.43%, while district schools lag far behind at 53.67%. Though, this could be partially explained by there only being 1 large charter school in the district, compared to 7 large district schools.

It is interesting to note, that the spending per student does not seem to positively impact test scores. Schools spending the least per student (less than $585), had the highest overall passing rate of 90.37%. This is compared to schools with the highest spending ($645-$680), which only had a overall passing rate of 53.53%. This should lead to a close examination of how the budget is allocated in the lower spending schools versus the higher spending schools.
